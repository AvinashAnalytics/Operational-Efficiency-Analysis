## Project Overview

This project aims to improve operational efficiency and employee engagement in a multi-departmental business. By leveraging data analysis techniques, the goal is to optimize decision-making processes related to employee performance, product sales, customer satisfaction, and inventory management using SQL and business intelligence tools.

## Problem Statement

The company is currently facing several operational inefficiencies:

1. **Employee Performance & Retention**: High turnover rates and inconsistent performance impact productivity.
2. **Product Sales & Customer Satisfaction**: Low customer feedback despite high sales, indicating quality or support issues.
3. **Supply Chain & Inventory Management**: Low inventory levels and supply chain risks that may lead to missed opportunities.
4. **Technology Usage & Future Planning**: Underutilization of technology and weak market research affects competitiveness.

## Key Analysis Questions

### Employee Performance:
- Which department had the highest average profit margin?

### Product Sales & Customer Satisfaction:
- Identify the product with the highest revenue in the HR department.

### Supply Chain & Inventory Management:
- Which supplier had the highest total inventory level?

### Employee Training & Sales:
- How many employees in the Sales department have completed training programs?

### Advanced SQL Questions:
- Includes window functions, stored procedures, and triggers for detailed analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is **synthetic** and was generated using a Python script created by me. It contains dummy data designed to reflect real-world business scenarios, which makes it suitable for testing and analysis of various operational processes like employee performance, sales, inventory, and more.

The data is structured to mirror the types of information you might find in a real-world business dataset, and includes:

- **Employees**: Employee names, departments, roles, salaries, performance scores, etc.
- **Products**: Product names, categories, cost, price, and profit margin.
- **Suppliers**: Supplier details.
- **Sales**: Sales data, including product names, units sold, and revenue.
- **Inventory**: Inventory levels, reorder points, and supplier data.
- **Employee Training**: Information on training courses completed by employees.
- **Employee Performance**: Performance data of employees based on task reviews.
- **Sales Performance**: Sales figures of employees and target achievements.

While the dataset is **not based on actual company data**, it closely mimics real-world data used by businesses to track operations. The dataset can be used for learning, practice, and experimentation with data analysis and business intelligence techniques.

### How the Dataset is Generated

The dataset is generated using a Python script, which creates synthetic data for multiple business tables. This script ensures that data is generated with consistency and randomness while maintaining a structured approach to represent a diverse business environment. 

The script used to generate the data can be accessed here:

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For querying, data manipulation, and analysis.
- **Google Sheets/Excel**: For data visualization and manipulation.
- **Python (Optional)**: For advanced analytics and visualizations, including libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
